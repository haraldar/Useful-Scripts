### livehosts.sh
---
##### What is it.
This bash-script is designed to just flood, respectfully, your home network with different pings and collecting all responding hosts, therefore returning all the live hosts.
##### Why is it.
The thought behind that script is, that as a newbie to nmap I keep getting inconsistencies when trying to get my smartphone to respond. Sometimes it responds, sometimes not, sometimes twice in a row, sometimes not twice in a row, but it most often responds when I keep changing between different pings. Therefore having to run multiple pings anyways, in my safe home environment I can just mass ping different flavors of nmap pings and collect all the hosts that respond.
